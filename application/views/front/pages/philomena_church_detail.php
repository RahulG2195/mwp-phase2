                <p>The St. Philomena's Cathedral, is a grand religious structure standing tall and is a unique example of heritage church in India with a history and deep religious significance. 
St. Philomena's Church is one of the largest churches in India and was first built to serve the British officers stationed at Mysuru and Srirangapatna. The present church, completed in 1936, was designed by the French architect, Daly, in the Neo Gothic style, and is modeled along the Cologne Cathedral in Germany. The church is dedicated to St. Philomena's, a Grecian princess who was martyred in the 4th century. Her relics were found centuries later in one of the Roman catacombs, and in 1926 the relic was handed over to Father Cochet, who requested the then king of Mysore, Maharaja Krishnarajendra Wadiyar to construct a church in the honour of St. Philomena's. The remnants of the St. Philomena's have been preserved in this church even today. 
St. Philomena's Church has been made in the shape of a cruciform. Besides the height of the church, another important feature which is not very common is the height and length of the church being of the same that is 175 feet. The Church's Trust is bound by the virtue of spreading, peace, and brotherhood. It also serves the underprivileged with utmost love and affection. Church's Trust being the caretaker also has the responsibility of retaining the iconic structure in a good state. It was recognized by the trust that the church building was in a state of colossal despair. It needed restoration on war footing as it was losing its sheen and becoming a fragile structure by each passing day.
 The task of restoration was humongous which needed a specialist and the responsibility of restoration was bestowed upon 'Savani Heritage Conservation Private Limited'. Being the recipient of 7 international awards and having the expertise and experience of restoring various heritage structures all over India, the credentials were more than enough to entrust the restoration responsibility of "St. Philomena's Church" 
Today, St. Philomena's Church is fully restored and looks stunning as ever. It is interesting to note about the legacy of a church dedicated to Greek saint, built by a French architect in German Style, for the British soldiers and paid for by a Hindu king.
