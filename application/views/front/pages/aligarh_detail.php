                <p>The Aligarh Muslim University has been often associated with magnanimity, power and beauty. The Iconic seven storied building is the state-of-the-art AMU campus and has been the center of attraction for educationists across the globe. It's nothing short of a structural marvel for an education building. Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) is an Indian public central university originally established by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan as Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875. A rare monument that serves as a window to the glorious past of ancient Indian culture, architecture, and education system that played an instrumental role in producing prodigies such as Zakir Husain, 3rd President of India; the former Vice-President of India Mohammad Hamid Ansari; Anwara Taimur the first and the only woman to be the Chief Minister of Assam. Sports persons like Dhyan Chand, Lala Amarnath and Zafar among the many alumni of the university. This beautiful state-of-the art structure with equally affluent interiors and architecture serves as reference point to various aspiring students in many diverse educational fields ranging from art, science, history, liberal studies, technology, law and literature all under one roof With time, traces of wear and tear were becoming evident on the monumental campus of AMU and it needed a revamp and beautification to restore its original shape and charm. The scale of work was mammoth and it needed the quality and precision of acumen to restore the heritage structure. Savani Heritage Conservation Pvt Ltd, a reputed name in the field of heritage conservation was assigned with the responsibility of restoration. Being the recipient of 7 international awards and having the expertise and experience of restoring heritage structures I.e. The Taj, Mumbai, Royal Structures in Bhuj, Sardar Gate in Junagadh, ancient Fort in Surat,., was more than enough to entrust the responsibility of AMU. Savani Heritage Conservation Pvt. Ltd., took up the task head on and executed the project in a span of _18 months. The restoration work was initiated by the AMU trust with a view to retain the legacy and pass it on as a heritage. This task of restoration would not have been possible but for one person, the Vice chancellor of the AMU who made remarkable efforts in generating funds and took the initiative to ensure that no stone is left unturned in getting the AMU campus up and ready for generations to come. The restored AMU Version 2.0 today is a mark of the never dying spirit of education and a source of Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>

History comes alive, when we walk into one of these Heritage structures – the sounds of warm trumpets, beating of drums, Sky high ceilings, Pieces of art, Grandiose of live of Kings and Queens, Voices of masses, Famous speeches and heart pounding sense of patriotism and glory. Every step into heritage takes us back in time and reminds us of the sense of architectural perfection, magic of artistry, weaving culture into the colourful tapestry of life and a sense of connection and bonding to help us define – ‘Who we are’ and be proud of our rich cultural & architectural heritage.</p>
